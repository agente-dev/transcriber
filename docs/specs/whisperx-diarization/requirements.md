# Requirements Document

## Introduction
Integration of WhisperX with speaker diarization capabilities to enhance the existing transcription service with automatic speaker identification, word-level timestamps, and improved performance for multi-speaker audio content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Speaker Diarization
**User Story:** As a user transcribing meetings or interviews, I want the system to automatically identify and label different speakers, so that I can easily distinguish who said what in the transcript.

#### Acceptance Criteria
Use EARS notation for clear, testable requirements:
1. WHEN a user uploads an audio file with multiple speakers THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and separate speaker segments
2. WHEN speakers are detected THEN the system SHALL label each segment with a unique speaker identifier (e.g., SPEAKER_1, SPEAKER_2)
3. WHEN the user knows the number of speakers THEN the system SHALL accept min/max speaker parameters
4. WHEN diarization is enabled THEN the system SHALL maintain at least 85% speaker identification accuracy for clear audio
5. WHEN speaker segments are generated THEN the system SHALL include start and end timestamps for each segment
6. WHEN diarization fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to non-diarized transcription with user notification

### Requirement 2: Word-Level Timestamps
**User Story:** As a content editor, I want precise word-level timestamps in transcripts, so that I can accurately synchronize text with audio/video content.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN word-level timestamps are requested THEN the system SHALL provide start and end times for each word
2. WHEN generating word timestamps THEN the system SHALL maintain accuracy within 0.5 seconds
3. WHEN word timestamps are included THEN the output format SHALL support both human-readable and machine-readable formats
4. WHEN Hebrew text is processed THEN the system SHALL correctly align RTL text with timestamps

### Requirement 3: Local Processing Capability
**User Story:** As a user with sensitive audio content, I want to process files locally without sending them to cloud APIs, so that I can maintain data privacy and security.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN local processing is selected THEN the system SHALL use WhisperX engine instead of OpenAI API
2. WHEN processing locally THEN the system SHALL NOT send audio data to external services
3. WHEN GPU is available THEN the system SHALL utilize it for accelerated processing
4. WHEN GPU is not available THEN the system SHALL fallback to CPU processing with appropriate warnings
5. WHEN processing large files locally THEN the system SHALL handle files exceeding the 25MB API limit

### Requirement 4: Performance Enhancement
**User Story:** As a user processing long audio files, I want faster transcription speeds, so that I can get results quickly without waiting for cloud API responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN using WhisperX with GPU THEN the system SHALL process audio at minimum 70x realtime speed
2. WHEN processing a 5-minute audio file THEN the system SHALL complete transcription within 10 seconds on GPU
3. WHEN processing files THEN the system SHALL use less than 8GB GPU memory with large-v2 model
4. WHEN batch processing is enabled THEN the system SHALL efficiently handle multiple files in sequence
5. WHEN processing long files THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Output Formats
**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want structured output formats with speaker information, so that I can easily analyze conversation patterns and extract insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN markdown output is selected THEN the system SHALL include speaker labels, timestamps, and conversation statistics
2. WHEN JSON output is selected THEN the system SHALL provide structured data with segments, speakers, and word-level details
3. WHEN SRT output is selected THEN the system SHALL generate subtitle-compatible format with speaker identification
4. WHEN output is generated THEN the system SHALL include speaker talk-time percentages
5. WHEN multiple speakers are detected THEN the system SHALL provide a speaker summary section

### Requirement 6: Backward Compatibility
**User Story:** As an existing user, I want my current workflow to continue working, so that I don't have to change my scripts and processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN no engine is specified THEN the system SHALL maintain existing OpenAI API behavior
2. WHEN using the CLI THEN the system SHALL accept all existing command-line arguments
3. WHEN output paths are specified THEN the system SHALL respect existing file naming conventions
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear migration guidance
5. WHEN using environment variables THEN the system SHALL continue to read from .env files

### Requirement 7: Hebrew Language Support
**User Story:** As a Hebrew-speaking user, I want accurate transcription and diarization for Hebrew audio, so that I can use the system for local content.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN Hebrew audio is processed THEN the system SHALL maintain transcription accuracy comparable to current OpenAI API
2. WHEN Hebrew text is output THEN the system SHALL properly handle RTL text direction
3. WHEN language is not specified THEN the system SHALL auto-detect Hebrew language
4. WHEN Hebrew diarization is performed THEN the system SHALL use appropriate language models
5. WHEN mixed Hebrew-English content is present THEN the system SHALL handle code-switching appropriately

### Requirement 8: Configuration Management
**User Story:** As a power user, I want to configure diarization parameters, so that I can optimize results for my specific use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN configuration is needed THEN the system SHALL support both CLI arguments and config files
2. WHEN Hugging Face models are used THEN the system SHALL securely manage access tokens
3. WHEN model selection is available THEN the system SHALL support choosing between whisper versions
4. WHEN compute type is configurable THEN the system SHALL allow float16/float32/int8 selection
5. WHEN VAD is configurable THEN the system SHALL allow enabling/disabling voice activity detection

### Requirement 9: Error Handling and Recovery
**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to gracefully handle errors and provide helpful feedback, so that I can troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN GPU memory errors occur THEN the system SHALL automatically retry with reduced batch size
2. WHEN model loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with solutions
3. WHEN diarization fails THEN the system SHALL continue with basic transcription
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL use cached models when available
5. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL save partial results if possible

### Requirement 10: Installation and Setup
**User Story:** As a new user, I want simple installation and setup procedures, so that I can start using the enhanced features quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN installing dependencies THEN the system SHALL provide clear pip/conda commands
2. WHEN GPU setup is required THEN the system SHALL include CUDA installation guidance
3. WHEN first run occurs THEN the system SHALL validate environment and provide diagnostics
4. WHEN models are needed THEN the system SHALL automatically download required files
5. WHEN setup is complete THEN the system SHALL provide verification commands
